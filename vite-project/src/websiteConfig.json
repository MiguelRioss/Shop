Think of it as the “sweet spot” between subtle and strong: a few drops, slow breaths, and ~10 minutes of unwind. Many people follow a simple rhythm (for example, 5–7 days on, 2–3 days off) to build consistency."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can Meso help with sleep issues?",
        "a": "Some customers prefer to take Meso after lunch, as they’ve reported it can interfere with sleep. Others, on the contrary, have experienced more vivid dreams. Everyone is different, so pair your drops with healthy sleep habits (dim lights, no screens, gentle music) and see what works best for you."

      {
        "q": "How long does it take to see results?",

        "q": "What’s the difference between microdosing and mesodosing?",
