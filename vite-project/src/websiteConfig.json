        "body": "A Letter from the Founder\nWhy I’m Writing This\nWe are currently in 2025, but back in 2014, everything in my life had collapsed.\nOn the outside, I looked like a man holding it all together: businesses, responsibilities, family, momentum…but inside, I was running on fumes. Years of burnout had stripped away my energy and clarity, and a crippling addiction was grinding down what was left. Holidays didn’t fix it. Willpower didn’t fix it. Coffee didn’t fix it. When the crash came, it nearly broke me.\nThis letter is the story of what followed: how I met iboga, what it taught me, and why that journey led to Mesodosing and the tinctures we make today. It’s not a white paper. It’s not a miracle story. It’s a note from someone who learned, (slowly and sometimes painfully) how to stand back up.\n\nMeeting Iboga\nDuring the worst of spiral, I was pointed toward an obscure, West African shrub: Tabernanthe iboga. I didn’t approach it as a trend or a shortcut. I approached it like a drowning man reaching for a rope.\nAcross two separate full “flood” treatments, iboga/ibogaine changed the trajectory of my life. It interrupted my cravings, softened withdrawals, and, more importantly, gave me enough quiet to listen. \nNot to a guru, not to a program, but to the part of me that wanted to live differently. \nThat grounding, insight and window of quiet didn’t solve everything, but it let me start.\n\nWhat It Taught Me\nHere’s the uncomfortable truth I discovered: no plant medicine is a one-step cure. \nNot iboga, not psilocybin, not ayahuasca. They can open a door…but you still have to walk through, and keep on showing up for yourself.\nWhat iboga gave me was clarity. With that clarity, I could finally do the inner work: honest conversations, different choices, steadier routines. Healing wasn’t fireworks. It was the day-in, day-out business of living a little better than yesterday.\n\nThe Middle Path: \nWhy Would You Not Want to Feel the Medicine?\nAfter those intense, deep dives with iboga which took a week out of my life each time, I didn’t want to keep swinging between the extremes of either doing nothing or blasting off again. \nI wanted something steady. \nThat’s where mesodosing came in.\nMesodosing lives in the middle. It isn’t the subtle whisper of microdosing, and it isn’t the thunderclap of a flood dose. It’s a sustainable, felt practice that supports real life: work, family, responsibilities, sleep. Measured, intentional and repeatable. A way to keep the gains without blowing up your week.\n\nHow the Tinctures Came to Be\nFrom 2016 onward, I co-founded, ran, and oversaw ibogaine centres across Europe and Mexico. In that time, I learned a lot about what helps…and about what gets in the way. \nPeople needed something simple, consistent, and respectful of the plant. Something that fit ordinary days and busy seasons. Something you could integrate into a life you were actively building.\nSo, we went back to basics and created tinctures that keep the character of the root intact while making daily use straightforward. No gimmicks. No complicated stacks. Just clean formulations and clear intentions.\nThree principles guided us:\n1.  Simplicity: Fewer moving parts, more usable routines.\n2.  Safety & Respect: Thoughtful dosing, quality sourcing, careful process.\n3.  Empowerment: You remain in charge of your pace, your needs, your life.\n\nThe Core Products\nIbotincture TA\nOur flagship tincture, made from Iboga Total Alkaloids. We chose TA because it carries more of the plant’s original “voice,” not just a single compound in isolation. It’s grounded, steady, and well-suited to mesodosing.\nIbotincture RB\nCrafted from Iboga Root Bark. A faithful, unpretentious expression of the plant, formulated for people who prefer a gentler, earth-forward profile.\nThese two are the foundation. Everything else we make starts here.\n\nThe Companions\nFrom the core tinctures, we developed simple pairings aimed at everyday needs: nothing flashy, just thoughtful combinations:\n•  TANIA™ (TA + Niacinamide) Built with burnout in mind: steadiness, support, and a clearer “yes/no” to your day.\n\n•  CLARA™ (TA + L-Theanine) Calm focus without edge. For deep work, difficult conversations, and softer evenings.\n\n•  LUCIA™ (TA + Saffron) A brighter baseline. Gentle lift, warmer outlook, still very much you.\nThey’re companions, not crutches, like extensions of the same core idea: make support accessible, repeatable, and human.\n\nWhat Mesodosing Looks Like in Real Life\nIt looks like choosing consistency over heroics. It looks like a few drops, taken twice a day, with intention, while you also:\n•  Get sunlight in the morning.\n•  Move your body most days.\n•  Eat like you respect yourself.\n•  Sleep like it matters (because it does).\n•  Tell the truth—especially to yourself.\n•  Ask for help when you need it.\nMesodosing isn’t the star of the show. You are. The tincture is there to steady your hand while you make the next right choice.\n\nThe Mesodose Movement\nHealing thrives in community. We built the Mesodose Movement to give people a place to learn, share, and be seen. Not as patients or projects, but as humans doing the work. Micro can be too faint. Macro can be too much. Mesodose is the middle…sustainable, grounded, and kind to your nervous system.\n\nA Note on Care\nI’m not offering medical advice here. I am sharing what helped me and what I’ve seen help others. If you have health conditions or take medications, speak with a qualified professional who understands this space. Go slowly. Listen closely. Keep what serves; leave the rest.\n\nWhy I Still Believe\nBecause I know what it’s like to burn out.\n\nI know what it’s like to slide into addiction and lose the plot.\n\nAnd I also know how powerful it is to get back up, to build a life that doesn’t need saving every few months.\nThat’s what Mesodosing is for. \nNot to dazzle you. \nTo steady you.\n\nBe safe,\n— Alvaro de Ferranti",
